# Security Response Plan Policy

**NIST CSF Functions: Detect (DE), Respond (RS), Recover (RC)**

## Purpose
To establish procedures for detecting, analyzing, containing, and recovering from cybersecurity incidents to minimize business impact and ensure rapid restoration of operations.

## Scope
Applies to all cybersecurity incidents affecting company systems, data, or operations.

## Incident Classification *(NIST CSF: DE.AE-2, RS.AN-2)*

### Severity Levels:
**Critical (Respond within 1 hour):**
- Active data breach or ransomware
- Complete system outages affecting business operations
- Confirmed advanced persistent threat

**High (Respond within 4 hours):**
- Suspected data breach
- Malware infections on multiple systems
- Unauthorized access to sensitive systems

**Medium (Respond within 24 hours):**
- Suspicious network activity
- Single system malware infections
- Failed security control alerts

**Low (Respond within 72 hours):**
- Policy violations
- Unsuccessful attack attempts
- Minor security configuration issues

## Response Team Structure *(NIST CSF: RS.CO-1)*

### Core Response Team:
- **Incident Commander**: Overall incident management and decisions
- **Security Analyst**: Technical analysis and forensics
- **IT Operations**: System administration and recovery
- **Business Representative**: Business impact assessment
- **Communications Lead**: Internal and external communications

### Extended Team (as needed):
- Legal counsel
- HR representative
- Vendor/supplier contacts
- Law enforcement liaison

## Response Procedures

### 8.1 Detection and Reporting *(NIST CSF: DE.AE-1, DE.DP-4)*
**Immediate Actions:**
- Document incident details with timestamp
- Classify incident severity level
- Notify Security Response Team within time requirements
- Preserve initial evidence and system state

### 8.2 Initial Assessment *(NIST CSF: RS.AN-1, RS.AN-3)*
**Analysis Steps:**
- Confirm incident scope and affected systems
- Assess potential business impact
- Determine if incident is ongoing or contained
- Identify attack vectors and indicators of compromise

### 8.3 Containment Strategy *(NIST CSF: RS.RP-1, RS.MI-2)*
**Short-term Containment:**
- Isolate affected systems from network
- Preserve evidence for analysis
- Implement temporary security controls
- Monitor for lateral movement

**Long-term Containment:**
- Apply security patches and updates
- Reconfigure security controls
- Update monitoring and detection rules
- Plan for system recovery

### 8.4 Eradication and Recovery *(NIST CSF: RC.RP-1, RC.IM-1)*
**Eradication Steps:**
- Remove malware and unauthorized access
- Close security vulnerabilities
- Update security configurations
- Verify system integrity

**Recovery Process:**
- Restore systems from clean backups
- Gradually return systems to production
- Monitor for recurring issues
- Validate business operations

## Communication Procedures *(NIST CSF: RS.CO-2, RS.CO-3)*

### Internal Communications:
- Incident status updates every 4 hours during active response
- Executive briefings for high/critical incidents
- Employee notifications as appropriate
- Post-incident summary report

### External Communications:
- Customer notifications per legal requirements
- Regulatory reporting within required timeframes
- Vendor/partner notifications as needed
- Law enforcement reporting for criminal activity

## Documentation Requirements *(NIST CSF: RS.AN-5, RC.IM-2)*
- Incident timeline and actions taken
- Evidence collection and analysis results
- Communication records and notifications
- Lessons learned and improvement recommendations

## Testing and Training *(NIST CSF: PR.IP-9, PR.AT-1)*
- Quarterly tabletop exercises
- Annual full-scale incident simulation
- Response team training and certification
- Plan updates based on exercise results
