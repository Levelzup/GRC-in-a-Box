# SMB Policy Implementation Guidelines

## Overview

This document provides practical guidance for implementing the NIST CSF-aligned security policies in your small to medium business (SMB) environment. These guidelines will help you prioritize, customize, and deploy the policies effectively.

## Getting Started with These Policies

### 1. Prioritization Approach

#### High Priority (Implement First - Weeks 1-4)
- **Password Protection Policy** - Fundamental security control
- **Data Breach Response Policy** - Legal and regulatory compliance
- **Email Policy** - High-risk attack vector
- **Acceptable Use Policy** - Foundation for all other policies

#### Medium Priority (Implement Second - Weeks 5-8)
- **Security Response Plan Policy** - Comprehensive incident management
- **Server Security Policy** - Critical infrastructure protection
- **Clean Desk Policy** - Physical security foundation
- **Disaster Recovery Plan Policy** - Business continuity

#### Lower Priority (Implement Last - Weeks 9-12)
- **Ethics Policy** - Culture and governance
- **Router and Switch Security Policy** - Infrastructure hardening
- **Wireless Communication Policy** - Network security
- **Implementation varies based on wireless usage**

### 2. Customization Steps

#### Before Implementation:
1. **Replace Placeholders**
   - `[Company Name]` with your organization name
   - `[Title/Role]` with specific job titles or names
   - `[Contact Info]` with actual contact information
   - `[Primary business application]` with your critical systems

2. **Adjust Technical Requirements**
   - Password complexity based on your current capabilities
   - Backup retention periods based on business needs
   - Response timeframes based on staffing levels
   - Encryption standards based on compliance requirements

3. **Modify Business Requirements**
   - Recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO)
   - Incident severity classifications
   - Communication procedures and contact lists
   - Training frequency and methods

4. **Add Industry-Specific Elements**
   - Healthcare: HIPAA compliance requirements
