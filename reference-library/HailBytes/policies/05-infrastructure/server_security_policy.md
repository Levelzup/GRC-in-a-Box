## Monitoring and Logging *(NIST CSF: DE.CM-1, DE.AE-3)*

### 11.9 Security Monitoring
- Implement endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions
- Configure comprehensive system and security event logging
- Monitor for unauthorized software installation and configuration changes
- Implement file integrity monitoring (FIM) for critical system files
- Set up automated alerting for security events

### 11.10 Log Management *(NIST CSF: DE.AE-3, PR.PT-1)*
- Forward logs to centralized security information and event management (SIEM)
- Retain security logs for minimum 1 year
- Protect log integrity with secure storage and access controls
- Regularly review logs for security incidents and anomalies
- Correlate server events with network and application security events

## Virtualization Security *(NIST CSF: PR.PT-2, PR.DS-8)*

### 11.11 Hypervisor Security
- Harden hypervisor platforms according to vendor security guides
- Implement virtual machine isolation and resource controls
- Monitor virtual machine sprawl and unauthorized VM creation
- Secure virtual machine templates and images
- Implement secure VM migration and backup procedures

### 11.12 Container Security *(NIST CSF: PR.DS-6, PR.PT-1)*
- Scan container images for vulnerabilities before deployment
- Implement container runtime security and monitoring
- Use minimal base images and remove unnecessary components
- Implement container network segmentation and policies
- Monitor container behavior for anomalous activity

## Cloud Server Security *(NIST CSF: ID.SC-4, PR.AC-5)*

### 11.13 Cloud Configuration
- Implement cloud security posture management (CSPM)
- Configure cloud security groups and network access controls
- Enable cloud provider security monitoring and logging
- Implement identity and access management (IAM) best practices
- Regular security assessment of cloud configurations

### 11.14 Shared Responsibility *(NIST CSF: ID.SC-1, ID.SC-2)*
- Understand cloud provider security responsibilities vs. customer responsibilities
- Implement additional security controls for customer-managed components
- Monitor cloud provider security advisories and updates
