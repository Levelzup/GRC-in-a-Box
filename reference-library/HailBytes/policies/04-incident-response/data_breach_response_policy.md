# Data Breach Response Policy

**NIST CSF Functions: Detect (DE), Respond (RS), Recover (RC)**

## Purpose
To establish procedures for detecting, responding to, and recovering from data security incidents to minimize impact and ensure compliance.

## Scope
Applies to all suspected or confirmed data breaches involving company or customer information.

## Incident Response Team
- **Incident Commander**: [Title/Role]
- **IT Security Lead**: [Title/Role]  
- **Legal Counsel**: [Contact Info]
- **Communications Lead**: [Title/Role]
- **Business Operations**: [Title/Role]

## Response Procedures

### 3.1 Detection and Analysis *(NIST CSF: DE.AE-1, DE.AE-2, DE.DP-4)*
**Immediate Actions (0-1 hours):**
- Document the incident with timestamp and initial assessment
- Determine if incident involves personal data, financial information, or business-critical systems
- Notify Incident Commander immediately
- Preserve evidence and avoid system changes that could impact investigation

### 3.2 Containment and Assessment *(NIST CSF: RS.RP-1, RS.AN-1)*
**Short-term Actions (1-24 hours):**
- Isolate affected systems to prevent further data exposure
- Assess scope: What data was involved? How many individuals affected?
- Determine root cause and attack vector
- Document all actions taken

### 3.3 Notification Requirements *(NIST CSF: RS.CO-2, RS.CO-3)*
**Regulatory Notifications:**
- Report to relevant authorities within required timeframes (typically 72 hours)
- Document notification timing and content

**Customer/Individual Notifications:**
- Notify affected individuals within required timeframes (typically 30 days)
- Provide clear explanation of what happened, what information was involved, and steps being taken

### 3.4 Recovery and Lessons Learned *(NIST CSF: RC.RP-1, RC.IM-1)*
- Implement additional security controls to prevent recurrence
- Monitor systems for ongoing threats
- Conduct post-incident review within 30 days
- Update security policies and training based on lessons learned

## Documentation Requirements
- Incident log with timestamps
- Evidence preservation procedures
- Communication records
- Recovery actions and timeline
