# Disaster Recovery Plan Policy

**NIST CSF Functions: Identify (ID), Protect (PR), Recover (RC)**

## Purpose
To ensure business continuity and rapid recovery of critical systems and data following a disaster or significant disruption.

## Scope
Covers all critical business systems, applications, and data necessary for company operations.

## Business Impact Analysis *(NIST CSF: ID.BE-3, ID.BE-4)*

### Critical Systems (RTO: 4 hours, RPO: 1 hour):
- [Primary business application]
- Email systems
- Financial systems
- Customer databases

### Important Systems (RTO: 24 hours, RPO: 4 hours):
- [Secondary applications]
- File shares
- Backup systems

## Recovery Procedures

### 4.1 Activation Criteria *(NIST CSF: RS.RP-1)*
The disaster recovery plan is activated when:
- Critical systems are unavailable for more than 2 hours
- Data center or primary facility is inaccessible
- Cyber incident significantly impacts business operations
- Natural disaster affects primary operations

### 4.2 Recovery Team Structure *(NIST CSF: RS.CO-1)*
- **DR Coordinator**: Overall recovery management
- **IT Recovery Team**: System and data restoration
- **Business Recovery Team**: Business process continuity
- **Communications Team**: Internal and external communications

### 4.3 Data Recovery Procedures *(NIST CSF: PR.IP-4, RC.RP-1)*
- Verify backup integrity before restoration
- Restore critical systems first based on priority order
- Test system functionality before declaring systems operational
- Document all recovery actions and timeline

### 4.4 Alternative Operations *(NIST CSF: RC.CO-3)*
- Activate backup facility or cloud resources
- Implement manual procedures for critical processes
- Establish alternative communication methods
- Coordinate with vendors and service providers

## Testing and Maintenance *(NIST CSF: PR.IP-9, RC.IM-1)*
- Conduct quarterly backup restoration tests
- Annual disaster recovery exercise
- Semi-annual plan review and updates
- Document test results and improvement actions
